# CSF-Pyramid
This is a visualization that I developed to help when discussing the functions of the NIST CSF

Each function builds a foundation for the functions above, for example you cannot effectively protect things that you don't know you have, or detect anamolys on your network, you can't respond to a security incident if you can't detect it etc.

This helps drive the focus on fundamentals like asset management or end point protection before you start diving into more advanced things like UBA.
